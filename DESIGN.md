# Design Document: Git-Based, Collaborative, Agent-Driven Text Adventure Game

## 1. High-Level Project Design and Goals

### 1.1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a text adventure game that leverages a Git repository as its game world and a Gemini agent as the game master. The core concept is to create a dynamic, interactive, and collaborative experience where players' actions, submitted as GitHub issues, directly influence the game state, which is represented by the file and directory structure of the repository.

### 1.2. Goals

*   **Create a dynamic and interactive game world:** The game world should evolve based on player actions and agent-driven content generation.
*   **Test the capabilities of a Gemini agent:** The project will serve as a testbed for the agent's abilities in file I/O, Git integration, natural language understanding, state management, and creative content generation.
*   **Enable collaborative gameplay:** The design should support multiple players, allowing them to interact with the same game world and each other.
*   **Promote emergent storytelling:** The interactions between players and the agent should lead to unique and unpredictable narratives.

### 1.3. Core Components

*   **Game World Repository:** A Git repository containing the game state.
    *   **Rooms:** Represented by directories.
    *   **Room Descriptions:** `description.md` files within each room directory.
    *   **Player Location:** A `player_location.txt` file tracking the current room of each player.
    *   **Items:** Represented by files within room or player inventory directories.
*   **Gemini Agent (Game Master):** An autonomous agent that processes player commands, updates the game state, and generates content.
*   **Player Interface:** GitHub issues will serve as the primary interface for players to submit commands.

## 2. Incremental, Milestone-Based Development Plan

### Milestone 1: The Single-Player Experience

This milestone focuses on establishing the core gameplay loop for a single player.

*   **Task 1.1: Basic World Generation:**
    *   Create a script to initialize a basic game world with a few interconnected rooms.
    *   Each room will have a `description.md` file.
    *   A `player_location.txt` file will be created to track the player's starting location.
*   **Task 1.2: Player Action Processor:**
    *   Develop the agent's ability to read and parse player commands from GitHub issue titles.
    *   Implement basic commands like "look," "go <direction>," and "take <item>."
*   **Task 1.3: Game State Updater:**
    *   Implement the logic for the agent to update the game state based on player actions.
    *   This includes modifying `player_location.txt` and moving item files.
*   **Task 1.4: Feedback Mechanism:**
    *   Implement the agent's ability to provide feedback to the player by commenting on the GitHub issue.
    *   The agent will close the issue after the action is resolved.

### Milestone 2: Agent-Driven World Expansion

This milestone focuses on empowering the agent to creatively expand the game world.

*   **Task 2.1: Dynamic Room Creation:**
    *   Implement the "create room" command, allowing players to request new rooms.
    *   The agent will use its creative capabilities to generate a description for the new room.
*   **Task 2.2: Inter-Room Connectivity:**
    *   The agent will automatically update the descriptions of adjacent rooms to reflect new exits.
*   **Task 2.3: Item Generation:**
    *   The agent will be able to generate new items with descriptions and place them in rooms.

### Milestone 3: The Multi-Player Experience

This milestone focuses on enabling multiple players to interact with the game world simultaneously.

*   **Task 3.1: Multi-Player State Management:**
    *   Modify the `player_location.txt` file to track the locations of multiple players.
    *   Create player inventory directories to store items for each player.
*   **Task 3.2: Player Interaction:**
    *   Implement commands that allow players to interact with each other, such as "give <item> to <player>."
*   **Task 3.3: Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Develop a mechanism for the agent to handle potential conflicts, such as two players trying to take the same item at the same time.

### Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Polish

This milestone focuses on adding depth and polish to the game.

*   **Task 4.1: NPC Integration:**
    *   The agent will be able to create and control non-player characters (NPCs) with their own behaviors and dialogue.
*   **Task 4.2: Quest System:**
    *   Implement a quest system that allows the agent to assign tasks to players.
*   **Task 4.3: Richer Content Generation:**
    *   Enhance the agent's content generation capabilities to create more detailed and engaging descriptions, items, and NPCs.

## 3. Gemini-Agent-Friendly Task Breakdown

The following is a breakdown of the work into tasks that are well-suited for a Gemini agent.

### Task: Implement "look" command

*   **Goal:** The agent should be able to process the "look" command and provide the player with the description of their current room.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Read the `player_location.txt` file to determine the player's current room.
    2.  Read the `description.md` file from the corresponding room directory.
    3.  Comment on the GitHub issue with the content of the `description.md` file.
    4.  Close the issue.

### Task: Implement "go <direction>" command

*   **Goal:** The agent should be able to process the "go <direction>" command and move the player to the new room.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Read the `player_location.txt` file to determine the player's current room.
    2.  Check if an exit exists in the specified direction. This can be done by checking for a subdirectory with the corresponding name (e.g., "north") or by parsing the `description.md` file for exit information.
    3.  If the exit exists, update the `player_location.txt` file with the new room's directory name.
    4.  Read the `description.md` file from the new room's directory.
    5.  Comment on the GitHub issue with the new room's description.
    6.  Close the issue.

### Task: Implement "take <item>" command

*   **Goal:** The agent should be able to process the "take <item>" command and move the item from the room to the player's inventory.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Read the `player_location.txt` file to determine the player's current room.
    2.  Check if the item file exists in the current room's directory.
    3.  If the item exists, move the item file to the player's inventory directory.
    4.  Comment on the GitHub issue with a confirmation message.
    5.  Close the issue.

### Task: Create a new room

*   **Goal:** The agent should be able to create a new room with a generated description.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a new subdirectory with the specified room name.
    2.  Use the Gemini API to generate a creative and engaging description for the new room.
    3.  Create a `description.md` file in the new directory with the generated description.
    4.  Update the `description.md` of the current room to mention the new exit.
    5.  Comment on the GitHub issue with a confirmation message and the description of the new room.
    6.  Close the issue.
